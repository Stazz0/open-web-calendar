In the Amman Valley Maker Space, we used Info Screens with the Agenda and recent projects.
The events were aggregated from different sources: Discourse and Outlook Calendar.
Whith this, we could inform the community about events that are going to happen on the Open Web Calendar Agenda view.
Events that were in the past were represented by a series of pictures.
